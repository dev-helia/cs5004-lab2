First run:
Displacement = 1.7320508075688772
Prof. Keith is on the move! His Velocity = 0.34641016151377546
Encountered an error: Elapsed time must be greater than 0. Provided: 0.0

Second run:
Displacement = 1.7320508075688772
Encountered an error: Elapsed time must be greater than 0. Provided: 0.0

The first run is good. The first velocity calculation ran successfully using elapsedTime = 5.
The second calculation failed because elapsedTime was 0,
which is invalid. The program threw an IllegalArgumentException.

The second run is incomplete. The program exited early, so the second calculation did not execute.
